  <h1>Hobbies</h1>
  <h2>Sports</h2>
  <p1>I am a very big sports fan. I played football, basketball, and baseball in high school, 
  and I continue to play baseball on an amateur team in the summer. My two primary positions this summer were second base and pitcher.
  I also enjoy golfing when I have time. My dad and I try to go as often as we can.</p1>
  <h2>Traveling</h2>
  <p1>My family goes on a trip every summer. This year, we flew to San Diego and spent about a week there.
  Last J-term, I took a class called Tales of the Sea. We got to spend two weeks on an old sailing ship in the Caribbean. 
  We learned about how to sail the boat, and read lots of articles about people sailing in the past. It was a very exciting 
  and interesting class. </p1>
  <h4>A few other places my family has traveled</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Alaska</li>
    <li>Glacier National Park</li>

    <li>Big Sky Montana</li>
    <li>San Francisco</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Reading</h2>
  <p2>Outside of playing sports, reading is probably my favorite thing to do in my free time. My favorite books of all time are: 
  Lord of the Rings, Lonesome Dove, and Game of Thrones.</p2>
